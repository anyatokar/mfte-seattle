              On the map, buildings with available units are marked with red
              pins and link to the building's official listing page. Dark blue

              In list view, buildings with available units are shown at the top.
              Each listing includes a link to the buildingâ€™s listing page, as
              well as details on the number of available units, the earliest
              availability date, maximum rent, and a short description.
